## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Extended Reasoning
AI thinks through complex questions step-by-step before responding.

**Example:**
```
Q: "Why would a student benefit from equipment rental?"

[Grok thinking: Consider cost, learning, accessibility,
 flexibility, different majors and use cases...]

A: "Students benefit because:
   1. Cost savings (professional equipment is expensive)
   2. Learning (hands-on experience)
   3. Accessibility (levels the playing field)
   4. Flexibility (borrow only when needed)
   5. ..."
```

### ⚡ Fast Database Queries
Equipment lookups are instant (no API needed).

```
Q: "What equipment do we have?"
A: [Instant database response] ✅ 50ms
```

### 💰 FREE Service Tier
`x-ai/grok-4.1-fast:free` = $0/month

```
No costs, no surprises, no billing needed!
Just get your API key and go.
```

### 🛡️ Automatic Fallback
If OpenRouter is down, local AI takes over automatically.

```
User never sees errors or downtime.
Always gets a helpful response.
```

### 📝 Conversation Memory
System preserves reasoning details across conversation turns.

```
Message 1: "How does booking work?" → AI explains workflow
Message 2: "Can I book multiple items?" → AI remembers context
Message 3: "How long can I borrow?" → AI uses full context
```
